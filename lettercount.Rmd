```{r load-hist-dat, include = FALSE}
hist_dat <- read.delim("histogram.tsv")
number_dat <- read.delim("number.tsv")
```

On most *nix systems, the file `/usr/share/dict/words` contains a bunch of words. Here, it contains `r sum(hist_dat$Freq)` words.

The most frequent word length is `r with(hist_dat, Length[which.max(Freq)])`.

Here I sort out all words which start and end with the same letter, the file `/usr/share/dict/number` contains all words satisfied the sorting scheme. And it contains `r sum(number_dat$freq)` same words

In order to list the distribution of these words which have same starting and ending letter, I generated a picture to see the distribution.

As you can see, the letter 's' has the most words which have same starting and ending letter.

Here is a histogram of word lengths.
