# Homework 9: Automating Data-analysis Pipelines
The aim of hw-09 is to modify the make activity pipeline.
To emphasize, this whole work is based on Jenny's [make-activity repo](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity), which is the original repo and all modification about pipelines are based on this.

## Requirements
  * Add one R script and one Rmd script, and add them to the make pipeline by modifying the Makefile.
  * The output should at least be a document (like html, pdf)
  * Additions need to be tied to the existing pipeline
  * Additions should correspond to some analysis
  
## Makefile requirements
  * If a dependency changes, running make should update the appropriate output 
  * Running make all should result in having all output presenT
  * Running make clean should remove all output
  * There shouldnâ€™t be any useless output, such as an Rplots.pdf file
  
  
  
## Implemented automation

  * R script file: generate two files(samechar.csv, number.tsv)
   				samechar.csv contains all words which start and end with the same letter
   				number.tsv counts the number of samechar words for each letter
   				
  * Rmd file: apart from the original report.rmd, here generate a lettercount.rmd to indicate the information 
  						based on words sorting
  
  * Results:![*Fig. 1* A histogram of words numbers(start and end with same letter) for each letter](numbhistogram.png)
